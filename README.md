# Machine-Learning
K MEANS CLUSTERING AND NAIVE BAYES ALGORITHM

**Algorithms**
**K-means Algorithm**
K-means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering data into k clusters. It iteratively assigns data points to clusters based on similarity and updates the cluster centroids.

**Naïve Bayes Algorithm**
Naïve Bayes is a supervised learning algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It assumes independence between predictors and is used for classification tasks. It calculates the probability of each outcome and predicts the most likely one.

**Modules**
**Administrator Module**
Login: Admins can log in to the system.
Upload Dataset: Admins can upload datasets for processing.
Clustering and Frequency Table Generation: The system clusters the dataset and generates frequency tables using K-means and Naïve Bayes algorithms.
User Module
Login: Users (patients) can log in to the system.
Input Data: Users can fill in their details.
Result Display: The system processes the input data and displays the predicted results.
Technical Stack
Java Development Kit (JDK)
The project is developed using the JDK, which provides the necessary tools for Java programming, including the compiler (javac) and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

**Java Platform (J2SE & J2EE)**
J2SE: Used for core Java functionalities.
J2EE: Used for developing enterprise-level web applications, including servlets and JSP.
JDBC
Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is used for database interactions, including connecting to the database, executing SQL queries, and managing results.

**Apache Tomcat**
Tomcat is used as the web server to host the application, supporting servlets and JSP.

**MySQL**
MySQL is used as the relational database management system for storing and managing data.

**Java Server Pages (JSP)**
JSP is used to create dynamic web content by combining HTML with Java code.

**Setup and Installation**
Prerequisites
JDK 8 or later
Apache Tomcat 7.0 or later
MySQL 5.7 or later
